This game was created for [Open Jam 2019](https://itch.io/jam/open-jam-2019/).

It's all about two people exploring the same place 100 years apart.

It's very rough around the edges because I decided I wanted to make my own engine and submit within 80 hours.

# Building/running

You will need allegro 5. Figure that part out yourself. It should be in most package managers.

To build, `make` should do the trick. The binary will be `bin/game`
